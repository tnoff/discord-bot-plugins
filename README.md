# Discord Bot Plugins

Example plugins for discord bot: https://github.com/tnoff/discord-bot.

## Markov

Uses Markov Chain logic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain to mimic chat in discord channels.

Use the command `on` to have the bot read message history for a given channel. Once turned on in a discord channel, reads channel history. For text messages in that channel, it takes text and breaks down each message into "leader" and "follower" pairs. For example, given the text:

```
Hey you guys should check out this cool song
```

It will generate the following pairs:
- "hey" (leader) and "you" (follower)
- "you" (leader) and "guys" (follower)
- "guys" (leader) and "should" (follower)
- etc ...

Then can use the `speak` command to generate a random sentence from channel history.

To mimic user messages, a word can be chosen at random or entered into the command. Given a that word, it finds which pairs have that word as a leader, and which words follow that word. It then calculates the chances a follower comes after a leader word.
For example, given the leader word "hey", there might be a 10% chance the next word is "there", a 25% chance the next word is "everybody", and so on.
In then uses weighted random chance to pick the next word, then uses this word as the leader, and repeats the process for either 32 words by default, or a larger amount of words if specified in the command.
